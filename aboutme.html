        <h3><i>Community Involvement</i></h3>

        <p>I am honored to serve as a volunteer educator at the Victorian Tamil Association (VTA), dedicating my time every Saturday to preserving and promoting Tamil language and culture. Tamil, one of the world's oldest languages, holds deep historical and literary significance, and I take great pride in contributing to its continuation through education and community engagement.</p>
        
        <p><b><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></b> <p><strong>Tamil Language Education:</strong>Teaching children to read, write, and speak Tamil fluently, helping them stay connected to their linguistic and cultural heritage. Witnessing their progress and enthusiasm is incredibly fulfilling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cultural & Community Engagement:</strong>Assisting in organizing community events, cultural programs, and educational initiatives that celebrate and uphold Tamil traditions within Victoria.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Leadership & Collaboration:</strong>Working closely with a diverse team to foster a strong, united Tamil community, while sharing knowledge and strengthening cultural ties.</p>

        <p>Being part of VTA has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to give back to the community, preserve Tamil heritage, and inspire the next generation to embrace their linguistic and cultural identity.</p>
